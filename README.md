# Wormy Circles!

This project creates a "worm" made of circles that moves around and grows! The worm's head (a red circle) follows your mouse, and you can make the worm longer by clicking on the screen. Each click adds a new segment to the worm!

## How It Works:

1. **Worm Movement**: 
   - The worm starts with a red head and a black body.
   - When you move your mouse, the worm's head (red circle) follows your mouse, and the other circles follow behind, just like a real worm!

2. **Grow the Worm**:
   - Every time you click on the canvas, a new segment is added to the worm.
   - The new segment can be black or grey, and it will try to stay connected to the rest of the worm, wiggling as it follows the others.

## What You Can Do:
- **Move your mouse**: See the worm's head follow your cursor, and the rest of the worm wiggle along!
- **Click to grow**: Each click adds another segment to the worm. Keep clicking to make the worm as long as you want!

## How to Run It:
- Open the file in a browser.
- Move your mouse and watch the worm wiggle and grow!

## What's Inside the Code:
- **Canvas**: This is the "playground" where the worm moves.
- **Ballbody Class**: This class helps create and draw each part of the worm.
- **Mouse Control**: When you move your mouse, the worm follows! When you click, new worm segments are created.

## Have Fun!
Grow your worm and watch it wiggle and move across the screen!
